Embedded Micro Protocol (EMP)
========================================

#### 1. Presentation

On the embedded target, several processes (tasks/threads/modules/etc,
depending on the target) are running and providing simple services.

The Agent and the different clients (assets) need to exchange data.
This micro protocol specifies the way of exchanging those data.

The communication is done using a standard IPC, i.e. a socket on
localhost. However the protocol does not require that socket must be
used, any transport layer that provide the same level of features can be
used.\
 On a linux target, the Agent proxy opens a socket on localhost,
default port is 9999. The client can connect to it when it needs to send
data or be able to receive data from a remote server.

#### 2. Frame format

All Commands expect a Response. The Response has the same command id and
the same request id, but the bit0 of the status byte is set to 1.

Commands and Responses can be interleaved, and a maximum of **256** Commands
(same or different ones) can be running at the same time.

A frame (Command or Response) is a set of bytes, composed of a header
followed by a payload.

\
 Header is composed of 8 bytes:
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frame section                    Size and description
-------------                    ---------------------------------------------------
command id                       2 bytes: Command id (See #List of commands)

type                             1 byte:\
                                  - bit0: 0-command, 1-response\
                                  - bit1-7: reserved (set to 0)

requestid                        1 byte: unsigned integer to code command 
                                 request id

payloadsize                      4 bytes: BigEndian coded unsigned integer.\ 
                                 Size of the payload in bytes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Command payload is encoded in JSON:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frame section                    Size and description
-------------                    ---------------------------------------------------
payload                          payload of '`payloadsize`' bytes of JSON
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Response Payload is composed of bytes which may be interpreted
according to the 'command' field from the header, however it contains at
least 2 bytes that are interpreted as the status of the response:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frame section                    Size and description
-------------                    ---------------------------------------------------
status                           2 bytes: if status == 0 the command went OK, \ 
                                          if status != 0 an error  occurred. \
                                 The status value is to be interpreted as a \ 
                                 [rc_ReturnCode_t](../c/returncodes_8h.html) type.

payload                          payload '`payloadsize-2`' bytes of JSON
